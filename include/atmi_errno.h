/* Atonomi Note:
 *
 * The original header as found atop the file in the FreeBSD source code
 * is kept intact following minor changes:
 *
 * Change: Removed errno define for eleven (11).
 * Change: Removed errno defines for all values thirty-five (35) or greater.
 *
 * Reason: Errno values greater than thirty-four (34), as well as eleven (11),
 * are inconsistent between Unix variants with regards to the name that maps
 * to a particular integral value. The defines that remaining in this file,
 * specifically those for integral values between one and ten inclusive, and
 * those between twelve and thirty-four inclusive ([1, 10] U [12, 34]) are
 * consistent among Unix variants (i.e. Linux, BSD/OS X, SUSv3, IRIX, etc.).
